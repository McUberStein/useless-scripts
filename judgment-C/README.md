# Judgment C
My attempt at rewritting judgment completely in C. Doesn't have as many options as the Python version yet, but I'm working on it.

# Build
To build, run `make`. Requires the VLC dev package. `libvlc-dev` on Ubuntu-based distros and either `vlc`(whole player) or`libvlc`(AUR, just libs) on Arch-based distros.
