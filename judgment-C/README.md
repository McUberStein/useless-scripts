# Judgment C
My attempt at rewritting judgment completely in C. Doesn't have as many options as the Python version yet, but I'm working on it.

# Build
To build, run `make`. Requires VLC.

# Usage
To use, either download a binary or compile and run `./judgment` from this directory. Then simply input the name of your waifu. 

NOTE: To avoid confusion, please provide your waifu's first and last name like so:`<first name>_<last name>`
For example, if your waifu was Himiko Toga from BNHA, you would do `himiko_toga`.
