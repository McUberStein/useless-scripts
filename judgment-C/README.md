# Judgment C
My attempt at rewritting judgment completely in C. Plays sound and prints braille ASCII art. Works best with semi-transparent terminals, but works in TTYs as well. Some sounds may be louder than others.

# Build
To build, run `make`. Requires VLC and on Debian-based distros the package `libvlc-dev`.

# Usage
To use, either download a binary or compile and run `./judgment` from this directory. Then simply input the name of your waifu. 

NOTE: To avoid confusion, please provide your waifu's first and last name like so:`<first name>_<last name>`
For example, if your waifu was Himiko Toga from BNHA, you would do `himiko_toga`.
